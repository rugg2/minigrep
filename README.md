# minigrep

This repo is for learning and teaching purposes.

This is a basic implementation in the Rust language of the command line tool "grep".
Steps explained in the Rust book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/

The minigrep command line tool takes in
- 2 arguments: string_to_search_for and file_path
- 1 optional environment variable: CASE_INSENSITIVE (if this variable exists with any value, the search will be case insensitive)
